Dual transformation requires businesses to simultaneously reposition their current business while also creating the future. In this chapter, we'll explore how to build a clear understanding of your unique transformation path.

Assessing Your Current Business
-------------------------------

The first step in mapping your transformation journey is to assess your current business. This involves looking at your strengths and weaknesses, as well as the external factors influencing your industry and market. Some key questions to consider include:

* What are our core competencies and competitive advantages?
* What are the biggest challenges facing our industry and market?
* How are we currently positioned in the market, and how does that need to change?
* What are our customers' needs and preferences, and how are they changing?
* What are the emerging technologies and trends that could impact our business?

Defining Your Future Business
-----------------------------

Once you have a clear understanding of your current business, the next step is to define your future business. This involves identifying new opportunities and areas for growth based on emerging technologies, market trends, and customer needs. Some key questions to consider include:

* What new products or services could we offer to meet evolving customer needs?
* How can we use emerging technologies to create new value propositions?
* What new markets or customer segments could we target?
* How can we leverage our existing capabilities and assets to support our future business?

Mapping Your Transformation Path
--------------------------------

With a clear understanding of both your current and future business, the final step is to map your transformation path. This involves identifying the specific steps and milestones needed to transition from your current business to your future business. Some key considerations when mapping your transformation path include:

* Prioritizing transformation initiatives based on potential impact and feasibility
* Identifying potential roadblocks and risks, and developing contingency plans
* Aligning internal resources and external partners to support the transformation
* Establishing clear metrics and targets to measure progress and success

Mapping your transformation journey is a critical step in successfully executing dual transformation. By assessing your current business, defining your future business, and mapping your transformation path, you can create a clear roadmap for repositioning your business while creating the future. Remember, successful dual transformation requires both vision and execution, as well as a willingness to take calculated risks and embrace change.
