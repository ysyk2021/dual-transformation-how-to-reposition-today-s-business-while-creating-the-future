In this chapter, we will explore techniques for creating the new business while managing risk as part of the dual transformation process. We'll discuss the importance of risk management, techniques for identifying and mitigating risks, and strategies for balancing innovation with risk.

The Importance of Risk Management
---------------------------------

Creating a new business model involves taking risks, but effective risk management is essential to ensuring that these risks are controlled and minimized. By identifying potential risks and implementing strategies to mitigate them, companies can reduce the likelihood of negative outcomes and increase their chances of success.

Effective risk management also demonstrates to stakeholders, such as investors and customers, that the company is taking a thoughtful and responsible approach to innovation.

Techniques for Identifying and Mitigating Risks
-----------------------------------------------

To manage risk effectively, companies should conduct a thorough risk assessment before launching a new business model. This might involve engaging with key stakeholders, such as customers and suppliers, to identify potential risks and challenges.

Once risks have been identified, companies should develop strategies to mitigate them. For example, they might implement quality control measures to ensure that products or services meet customer expectations, or establish contingency plans to address unexpected disruptions in the market.

Strategies for Balancing Innovation with Risk
---------------------------------------------

Balancing innovation with risk is a delicate balance. Companies must be willing to take calculated risks to create new business models and drive growth, while also being mindful of potential negative outcomes.

One strategy for balancing innovation with risk is to start small and test new ideas in a controlled environment before scaling up. By piloting a new business model in a select geographic region or market segment, companies can validate its feasibility and potential impact before investing significant resources.

Another strategy is to establish clear criteria for evaluating risks and opportunities, and using data-driven decision-making to determine which ideas to pursue. By prioritizing ideas that have a strong potential upside and a manageable level of risk, companies can increase their chances of success while minimizing potential negative outcomes.

Conclusion
----------

Creating the new business while managing risk is a crucial part of the dual transformation process. Effective risk management involves identifying and mitigating potential risks, while balancing innovation with risk to drive sustained growth and success over the long term. By taking a thoughtful and responsible approach to risk management, companies can demonstrate their commitment to innovation while minimizing potential negative outcomes.
