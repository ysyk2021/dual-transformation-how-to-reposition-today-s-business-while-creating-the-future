=========================================================================================================================

In this chapter, we will explore techniques for developing a leadership team that supports dual transformation - the process of simultaneously repositioning a company's core business while creating new growth opportunities. We'll discuss the importance of aligning leadership around a shared vision, techniques for identifying and developing effective leaders, and strategies for creating a culture of innovation and agility.

Aligning Leadership Around a Shared Vision
------------------------------------------

To develop a leadership team that supports dual transformation, it is essential to align leaders around a shared vision for the future of the organization. This might involve engaging with key stakeholders to identify strategic priorities, establishing clear goals and metrics for success, and communicating these priorities and goals clearly and consistently to all stakeholders.

Effective alignment requires a shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing the organization, as well as a willingness to embrace change and take calculated risks in pursuit of strategic objectives.

Identifying and Developing Effective Leaders
--------------------------------------------

To develop a leadership team that supports dual transformation, companies should invest in leadership development programs and training initiatives. These might include mentoring and coaching, workshops and seminars, or immersion experiences in innovative ecosystems outside the company.

Companies should also establish clear expectations for performance and behavior, and provide incentives to encourage employees to embrace new ways of working. This might involve recognizing and rewarding employees who demonstrate excellence in capability building, innovation, and agility.

Creating a Culture of Innovation and Agility
--------------------------------------------

To support dual transformation, companies must create a culture that values innovation, agility, and continuous improvement. This requires a deliberate and strategic approach, involving investment in resources such as training materials, tools, and technology to support learning and development.

Companies should also establish regular communication channels to keep employees informed about the company's progress towards its strategic objectives, and provide opportunities for feedback and input. This might involve creating cross-functional teams or task forces to drive innovation and agility, or encouraging employees to participate in innovation initiatives outside their immediate area of responsibility.

Conclusion
----------

Developing a leadership team that supports dual transformation is essential to driving sustained growth and success over the long term. By aligning leadership around a shared vision, identifying and developing effective leaders, and creating a culture of innovation and agility, companies can position themselves for success in a rapidly changing business environment. Effective leadership development also enables companies to adapt to emerging technologies and market conditions, positioning them for continued growth and success.
