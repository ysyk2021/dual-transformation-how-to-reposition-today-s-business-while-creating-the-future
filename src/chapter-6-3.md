* Empower employees: Give employees the autonomy to make decisions and take ownership of their work.

To align leadership with the company's vision for the future, it's essential to ensure that leaders have a clear understanding of the company's goals and objectives. Here are some strategies to consider:

* Develop a shared vision: Work with leaders across the organization to develop a shared vision for the future.
