In this chapter, we will explore common obstacles and challenges that companies may face when building capabilities for dual transformation - the process of simultaneously repositioning a company's core business while creating new growth opportunities. We'll discuss strategies for overcoming these obstacles and building the necessary skills and capabilities to drive sustained growth and success over the long term.

Common Obstacles and Challenges
-------------------------------

Building capabilities for dual transformation can be challenging, particularly in cases where there are multiple moving parts and complex relationships between different parts of the business. Some common obstacles and challenges include:

* Resistance to change: Employees may be resistant to change, particularly if they perceive it as a threat to their job security or established ways of working.

* Lack of resources: Building new capabilities requires investment in resources such as training materials, tools, and technology, which may be limited.

* Inadequate leadership support: Effective capability building requires strong support from senior leaders, who must set the tone at the top and model the desired behaviors and values.

* Difficulty in identifying skill gaps: Identifying skill gaps within an organization can be difficult, particularly if employees lack self-awareness or if skills requirements are changing rapidly.

Strategies for Overcoming Obstacles and Challenges
--------------------------------------------------

To overcome these obstacles and challenges, companies should adopt a deliberate and strategic approach to capability building. This might involve:

* Establishing clear expectations for performance and behavior, and providing incentives to encourage employees to embrace new ways of working.

* Investing in resources such as training materials, tools, and technology to support learning and development.

* Creating a culture that values continuous learning and improvement, and recognizing and rewarding employees who demonstrate excellence in capability building.

* Engaging with external experts or partners to provide guidance and support in identifying skill gaps and developing targeted training and development programs.

* Providing opportunities for employees to apply new skills and knowledge in real-world environments, allowing them to gain experience and develop confidence in their abilities.
