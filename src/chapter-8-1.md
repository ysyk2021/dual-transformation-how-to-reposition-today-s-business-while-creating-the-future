In this chapter, we will explore the importance of measuring the impact of dual transformation - the process of simultaneously repositioning a company's core business while creating new growth opportunities. We'll discuss the benefits of effective measurement, common obstacles and challenges, and strategies for building a culture of data-driven decision-making.

The Benefits of Effective Measurement
-------------------------------------

Measuring the impact of dual transformation is crucial to understanding whether the process is working as intended, and whether it is driving sustained growth and success over the long term. By tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) and other transformation metrics, companies can ensure that they are on track to achieve their strategic objectives, and make adjustments as needed.

Effective measurement also allows companies to communicate the impact of dual transformation to stakeholders, including investors, employees, and customers. By demonstrating concrete progress towards their goals, companies can build trust and confidence in their future prospects.

Common Obstacles and Challenges
-------------------------------

Measuring the impact of dual transformation can be challenging, particularly in cases where there are multiple moving parts and complex relationships between different parts of the business. To overcome these challenges, companies should be prepared to invest in data infrastructure, talent, and training, and prioritize collaboration and communication between different teams and departments.

Companies should also be prepared to adapt their metrics and measurement systems over time, as their business evolves and new opportunities and challenges arise.

Strategies for Building a Culture of Data-Driven Decision-Making
----------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, measuring the impact of dual transformation requires a culture that values data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement. Leaders must establish clear expectations around data collection and analysis, and incentivize employees to use data to inform their decisions and actions.

This might involve providing training and resources to help employees develop data literacy skills, or establishing a system of rewards and recognition for employees who demonstrate excellence in data analysis and reporting.

By building a culture of data-driven decision-making, companies can ensure that they are making informed, strategic decisions about their dual transformation efforts, and driving sustained growth and success over the long term.

Conclusion
----------

Measuring the impact of dual transformation is essential to understanding whether the process is driving sustained growth and success over the long term. By tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) and other transformation metrics, companies can adjust their strategies and tactics as needed, and communicate progress to stakeholders. Effective measurement also requires a culture of data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement, which can be built through investment in data infrastructure, talent, and training.
