Measuring the impact of dual transformation can pose its own set of challenges. Here are some common obstacles and challenges that organizations may face when measuring the impact of dual transformation:

* Lack of data: Organizations may lack the necessary data or resources to effectively track and analyze transformation metrics.

* Resistance to change: Employees or leaders may be resistant to changes in processes or technologies that are needed to track and measure transformation metrics.

To address these challenges, it's important to prioritize resources, establish clear data collection and analysis processes, and communicate the importance of data-driven decision-making effectively to all stakeholders.

Building a Culture of Data-Driven Decision-Making
